# ETLs

Some ETLs produced and for the Urban Planning Department of the City and County of San Francisco. These ETLs handled the extracting of data from several sources (some internal, some in the web), the transformation of these files in an AWS server, and the loading into the San Francisco Transportation Information Map:

## Last Modified

The final version of these ETLs was released by the end of November 2017.
No more updates will be released; this is the final version of these ETLs

## How can I use these ETLs?

These ETLs have little to no value outside of the environment they were created for. Moreover, some sensitive information has been excluded, which impairs its functionality.

They may only serve as syntax and structural reference. Also, they are heavily based on ESRI's ArcGIS software, which is used for the geoprocesses of the data.

### Installing
